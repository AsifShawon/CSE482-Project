            <p class="CourseDet lead" id="vision"> As cautious and responsible parents we all want our children to grow
                up strong, confident and with the
                ability to defend themselves in this unpredictable and scary world. Besides, in this new age of
                technology, our children do not get to do as much physical activity as we want them to. Our courses
                specially crafter and curated for your child not only will equip them with the necessary skills of self
                defense, but also will be a great way for them to get introduced to physical exercise as an athletic
                pursuit/a self- defense mechanism. With 50+ experts with tons of experience, we have a wide array of
                courses you can choose from to make your child's experience a great, enlighteing and fun one.</p>
